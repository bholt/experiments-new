{"tagline":"Library for running and tabulating experiments and parameter sweeps.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","name":"Experiments","body":"# Experiments\r\n------------\r\n\r\nIn the course of research, we end up running enormous amounts of individual experiments and parameter sweeps. Managing and tabulating the output of these experiments is very mechanical and we figured it ought to be automated a bit. This library is designed to make your life easier by letting you specify the repetitious parts of experiments, such as the command to run and where to put arguments, and then allows you to specify parameters to use, potentially multiple values for each parameter. This script then enumerates all possible combinations of parameters, runs the experiments, collects their results, and saves them in a SQL database.\r\n\r\nThis library consists entirely of a single Ruby source file: `experiments.rb`, but there are several dependencies:\r\n\r\n- Ruby version >= 1.9\r\n- Rubygems (should have come with the latest Ruby installations)\r\n- gems:\r\n  - grit (git integration)\r\n  - sequel (database output)\r\n  - sqlite3 (note: this also requires sqlite3 itself to be installed)\r\n  - open4\r\n  - awesome_print\r\n\r\nTo \"install\", `experiments.rb` simply needs to be on your RUBYPATH, so you can either add this directory to your RUBYPATH, or symlink the file into an existing directory set aside for Ruby libraries on your system.\r\n\r\nThe file `run_sample.rb` contains a toy run script for use in an application. This can be placed anywhere convenient and modified for your own use. See the file for more information about usage. The `examples` directory contains more realistic scripts used in [Grappa](http://sampa.cs.washington.edu/grappa). In particular, they contain more useful output parsers.\r\n"}
